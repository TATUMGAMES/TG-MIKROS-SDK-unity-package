## What Is MIKROS?
MIKROS is a service aimed at game developers which provides useful information and clear analytics in a sharing ecosystem, also known as data pooling. These insights about user behaviour can help developers understand their clientele better including their spending habits. MIKROS uniquely displays its analytics in a simple format with the goal of connecting game developers and advertisers to a full understanding of the problems they are looking to solve. This is due to all the data being in the MIKROS ecosystem.

## How Dose MIKROS Work?
MIKROS sorts users by spending and activity levels in its ecosystem. This differs from how data is currently managed by competitors as they do not offer any data pooling. Game developers and advertisers can then view reports in a dashboard with valuable information which is needed to identify areas to improve their customer experience. With MIKROS, advertisers can now be certain that their ads are being shown to verified spenders.
